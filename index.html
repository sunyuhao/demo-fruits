		<h2>POWER FRUITS FOR BETTER HEALTH</h2>
			<p>
				Fruit-like anything else with sugar in it-gets a bad rap in the physique business. The prevailing thought behind this hysteria is that anything with sugar in it is going to end up planted jiggly on your waistline. But fruit has way more to offer than, say, that Cinnabon-however tasty and heavenly that cinnamon roll may be-you picked up at the mall yesterday.
			</p>
			<p>
				There's something important you're not doing-and you're far from alone in your torpidity, because most Americans are every bit as lax as you are on this score. Too many guys aren't filling the recommended half of their plates with fruit and vegetables, and if you're part of this crowd it's something you'll need to address, because your diet is likely deficient in the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals your body needs for optimum health-and no, canned fruit and fruit juices don't count.
			</p>
			<p>The problem with fructose arises when the liver glycogen levels are full. At this point, fructose gets converted to fat and that helps to increase the size of the fat cells. Since we aren't equipped with fuel gauges to tell us how full our livers are, many bodybuilders opt for avoiding fruit all together. But such extreme measures are not necessary. There are actually a few times when fruit is not only okay-it's actually helpful. </p>

		<h2>Purple mangosteen</h2>
			<p>
				Mangosteen is a native plant to Sunda Islands and the Moluccas of Indonesia. Highly valued for its juicy, delicate texture and slightly sweet and sour flavour, the mangosteen has been cultivated in Java, Sumatra, Mainland Southeast Asia, and the southern Philippines since ancient times. The 15th-century Chinese record Yingyai Shenglan described mangosteen as mang-chi-shih, a native plant of Java of white flesh with delectable sweet and sour taste.

		<h2>Coconut</h2>
			<p>
			The coconut is known for its great versatility as seen in the many uses of its different parts and found throughout the tropics and subtropics. Coconuts are part of the daily diets of many people. Coconuts are different from any other fruits because they contain a large quantity of "water" and when immature they are known as tender-nuts or jelly-nuts and may be harvested for drinking. When mature, they still contain some water and can be used as seednuts or processed to give oil from the kernel, charcoal from the hard shell and coir from the fibrous husk. The endosperm is initially in its nuclear phase suspended within the coconut water.

		<h2>Kiwi</h2>
			<p>
				Kiwi are flightless birds native to New Zealand, in the genus Apteryx and family Apterygidae. At around the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites (which also consist of ostriches, emus, rheas, and cassowaries), and lay the largest egg in relation to their body size of any species of bird in the world. DNA sequence comparisons have yielded the surprising conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the extinct Malagasy elephant birds than to the moa with which they shared New Zealand. There are five recognised species, two of which are currently vulnerable, one of which is endangered, and one of which is critically endangered. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The kiwi is a national symbol of New Zealand, and the association is so strong that the term Kiwi is used internationally as the colloquial demonym for New Zealanders.

		<h2>Guavas</h2>
			<p>
				Guavas are common tropical fruits cultivated and enjoyed in many tropical and subtropical regions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Psidium guajava is a small tree in the Myrtle family , native to Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. Although related species may also be called guavas, they actually belong to other genera, such as the "pineapple guava" Acca sellowiana.
